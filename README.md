# Hi, I’m Abdulaziz
---

**Computer Science undergraduate — University of Bristol**  
**Co-Founder & Co-President — Game Development & Design Society (GDD)**  

I build real-time web systems, develop games with Godot and Unreal Engine, and run workshops that help students learn game design and development.

I’m currently exploring several areas of computing — full-stack development, real-time systems, game technology, and applied AI. I enjoy building projects end-to-end, experimenting with new tools, and I’m still discovering what I want to specialise in.
